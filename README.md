# beamertheme-MinimalGreen
Most available beamer themes seem quite heavy. MinimalGreen tries to focus on content.

Heavily inspired by Martin Bjeldbak Madsen's theme found here: https://github.com/martinbjeldbak/beamertheme-bjeldbak

## Issues

I'd like the fontsize in code listings reduced, but the basicstyle command refuses to respond to anything I set.

Padding around example bocks is awkward and needs manual correction.
